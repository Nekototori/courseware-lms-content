# An Introduction to the Console
The Puppet Enterprise Console is a web-based graphical user interface for your infrastructure. This is a high level overview of the Console. Each main area will be given its own course (i.e. Event Inspector, Live Management, etc.) in the near future.

With the console you can:

* manage node requests to join the Puppet deployment.
* assign Puppet classes to nodes and groups.
* view reports and activity graphs.
* trigger Puppet runs on demand.
* browse and compare resources on your nodes.
* view inventory data.
* invoke orchestration actions on your nodes.
* manage console users and their access privileges.

At the end of this course you will be able to:

* describe the general layout and functional areas of the PE console.

      <p>When you first start using Puppet, you might include configuration details in
your Puppet code.  For example, when setting up a database server, you might
hard-code the hostname of the server in the Puppet manifest. As your puppet
implementation grows, this can become unmanageable. Making a small change to a
system might mean making changes across multiple parts of your Puppet code.
Hiera offers a robust and straightforward way to separate data from code.</p>

      <p>The name &#8216;Hiera&#8217; stands for hierarchy, but the most basic functional Hiera
config doesn&#8217;t have to be hierarchical.  Let&#8217;s set up a simple flat lookup using
Hiera.</p>

      <p>Imagine you want to set a default message of the day on your servers.  You
could do this with the following Puppet code:</p>

      <pre>
$message = "Welcome to try.puppet.com. Don't break anything!"
file { '/etc/motd':
  content =&gt; $message
}
</pre>

      <p>This works just fine, but the more you hard-code data into your Puppet code,
the harder it is to maintain.  What if you wanted to share that code with
someone outside your company? You&#8217;d have to remember to go in and clean out any
potentially sensitive data across your entire codebase.</p>

      <p>Even with the simplest configuration, Hiera offers a robust way to separate that
data from your code.</p>

      <p>Using Hiera, the code would look this this:</p>
      <pre>
$message = hiera('message')
file { '/etc/motd':
  content =&gt; $message
}
</pre>

      <p>You&#8217;ll need to tell Hiera where to find the data, this is done with the
<code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml</code> file.  The file puppet installs by default
will work:</p>

      <pre>
---
:backends:
  - yaml
:hierarchy:
  - "nodes/%{::trusted.certname}"
  - common
:yaml:
# datadir is empty here, so hiera uses its defaults:
# - /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/%{environment}/hieradata on *nix
# - %CommonAppData%\PuppetLabs\code\environments\%{environment}\hieradata on Windows
# When specifying a datadir, make sure the directory exists.
  :datadir:
</pre>

      <p>The lines starting with <code>#</code> are comments, and for now just ignore the first item
under <code>:hierarchy:</code>, we&#8217;re going to start with <code>common</code>. In future lessons, 
we&#8217;ll add some more levels and use the defaults more. We&#8217;ll keep &#8220;common&#8221; as 
the base of the hierarchy as a place to hold global defaults.</p>

      <p>Notice in the comment about default <code>datadir</code> that it says your data will be in
<code>/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/%{environment}/hieradata</code>.
<code>%{environment}</code> part will be interpolated by puppet to refer to your code
environment.  The default is <code>production</code>, so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll use for this
exercise.</p>

      <p>We still need to add the actual data. Do this by creating a file called
<code>common.yaml</code> in the <code>datadir</code> that&#8217;s listed in <code>hiera.yaml</code></p>

      <p><code>common.yaml</code> looks like this:</p>
      <pre>
---
message: "Welcome to try.puppet.com. Don't break anything!"
</pre>

Practice</p>
    </div>

    <div class="instruction-content">

      <p>Now that you have a sense of the basic config, try adding another key/value
pair to the <code>common.yaml</code> on the practice VM. Experiment with changing things
to see what results you get. Don&#8217;t worry if you break something, just reload
the page to get a fresh machine.</p>

Instructions</p>

    <div class="instruction-content">

      <p>To test out Hiera, you can use make a simple manifest like the examples above
and use <code>puppet apply</code>. The notify resource can be handy for this.  For example, 
to lookup the value of &#8220;message&#8221;, create a file <code>/root/message.pp</code>:</p>

      <pre>
notify{hiera('message'):}
</pre>

      <p>To see the hiera value run <code>puppet apply /root/message.pp</code></p>

      <p>Add a second key by editing <code>/etc/puppetlabs/code/hieradata/common.yaml</code></p>

Notes</p>
    </div>

    <div class="instruction-content">

      <p>Hiera data should live on the puppet master. For learning how hiera works, 
we&#8217;re editing code on the agent and using <code>puppet apply</code>.</p>

      <p>When you&#8217;re ready to move on, just click to the next section, the practice
machine will shut down automatically when you&#8217;re done.</p>

      <p>If you need a refresher in the Linux command line or in using the vim text
editor, take a look at those courses before proceeding.</p>

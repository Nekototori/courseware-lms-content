      <p>Hiera is pretty handy for keeping all of your data in one place, when you add a
level of hierarchy it becomes a lot more powerful.</p>

      <p>Let&#8217;s imagine you have two webservers, one is in your &#8220;prod&#8221; app tier and one 
is in your &#8220;dev&#8221; app tier.  They are mostly the same, but they need to use 
different DNS servers.</p>

      <p><em>Note: In puppet, the word <code>environment</code> refers to a set of puppet code that
applies to a certain set of nodes.  We use the term <code>app tier</code> to refer to a
physical set of nodes. This distinction isn&#8217;t important for this course but it
becomes important when using recommended best practices for managing puppet code.</em></p>

      <p>Without Hiera, your code might look like this:</p>
      <pre>
case $::app_tier {
  'prod': {
    $dns_server = 'proddns.puppetlabs.vm'
  }
  'dev': {
    $dns_server = 'devdns.puppetlabs.vm'
  }
}
profile::dns_server {
  dns_server =&gt; $dns_server,
}
</pre>

      <p>This is simple enough for two servers. What if you add developer workstations
or another pre-production test app tier? What if there are more configuration
differences between app tiers? The code can quickly get out of
control.</p>

      <p>Let&#8217;s look at how the code would appear in using Hiera:</p>
      <pre>
$dns_server = hiera('$dns_server')
profile::dns_server {
  dns_server =&gt; $dns_server,
}
</pre>

      <p>So what happened to the details? Now they&#8217;re in two separate files, one for
each app tier. They go in the same directory as <code>common.yaml</code></p>

      <p>Here&#8217;s the prod tier, we&#8217;ll call it <code>prod.yaml</code></p>
      <pre>
---
dns_server: 'proddns.puppetlabs.vm'
</pre>

      <p>And here&#8217;s the dev tier, we&#8217;ll call it <code>dev.yaml</code></p>
      <pre>
---
dns_server: 'devdns.puppetlabs.vm'
</pre>

      <p>There&#8217;s one place you need to change things, that&#8217;s in your <code>hiera.yaml</code>.
You&#8217;ll have to add another level to the hierarchy, above &#8220;common&#8221;. Since we
want to use the value of the app tier fact and not just the word &#8220;app_tier&#8221;,
we&#8217;ll need to add some special syntax.</p>

      <p>Here&#8217;s what the <code>hiera.yaml</code> needs to look like:</p>
      <pre>
---
:backends:
  - yaml
:hierarchy:
  - "nodes/%{::trusted.certname}"
	- "%{::app_tier}"
  - common

:yaml:
# datadir is empty here, so hiera uses its defaults:
# - /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/%{environment}/hieradata on *nix
# - %CommonAppData%\PuppetLabs\code\environments\%{environment}\hieradata on Windows
# When specifying a datadir, make sure the directory exists.
  :datadir:
</pre>

      <p>Before we go further, why not try out what you&#8217;ve just learned?</p>

      <p>You will need to set the <code>app_tier</code> fact. To do this create an external
fact called app_tier, by creating a file in <code>/opt/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/my_facts.txt</code>
with the following contents</p>
      <pre>
app_tier=prod
</pre>

      <p>This time, try this one-liner puppet apply command to get the value of dns_server.
<code>puppet apply -e 'notify{hiera("dns_server":)}'</code></p>

      <p>Test out a few different app tiers by changing the value of your external fact.</p>

Instructions

    <div class="instruction-content">

      <p>Try adding another app tier called <code>qa</code>, or even another level in the
hierarchy that&#8217;s based on the <code>hostname</code> fact instead of <code>app_tier</code>.</p>

      <p>Remember, <code>hostname</code> is a built in fact to find your hostname run
<code>facter hostname</code>.</p>
